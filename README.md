This is a custom node we created that will allow you to generate text in any font through ComfyUI.  It will pull the fonts from a folder you set up. It accets TTF and OTF files.
You can change the background and font color, font size as well as the placement of the text.
Just git clone the repo to your custom nodes folder in ComfyUI.

We hope to work a better verson that will generate within the ComfyUI gui when you process an image.
